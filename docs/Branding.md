# Branding

## Logo Design

>   Well-designed logos help customers [form emotional connections](https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/choong/intellcont/The role of brand logos in firm performance-1.pdf) to favorite brands, making them an important asset for any business. For best results, your branding package should include several variations of your custom logo. Having multiple versions of a logo makes it easier to build a consistent brand identity across all formats.
>
>   Your primary logo may look great in print, but it's helpful to have smaller submarks in your branding package. Whether you operate a small business or a large corporation, your [logo color schemes](https://dribbble.com/resources/logo-color-schemes) and fonts should also be consistent. A high level of consistency makes it easier for customers to associate logo variations and submarks with your overall brand.



## Color Palette

To maintain a consistent visual identity, it's important to include a color palette in your brand package. A color palette contains all the brand colors you use to create signage, product packaging, stationery, social media headers, and other promotional materials. The colors you choose should represent your brand's personality and strive to elicit an emotional response from members of your target audience.

It's important to be as detailed as possible when creating a color palette for your branding kit. Each color should be identified by its Pantone Color code or CMYK/RGB values, not vague descriptions like "light green" or "dark purple." Using specific color codes ensures that every in-house or freelance [graphic designer](https://dribbble.com/resources/graphic-designer-salary) uses exactly the right shade of each color, [promoting consistency](https://www.pantone.com/color-systems/pantone-color-systems-explained) in all brand design elements.

## Brand Typography

Typography-related decisions have a major impact on how people view your brand. After all, the masthead of The New York Times wouldn't look quite the same without its signature decorative serifs and Engravers' Old English BT font. Typography refers to the overall appearance of your text.

Whether you're designing a printed banner or an email header, you need to think about font type, text size, and text placement. [Negative space](https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/10/04/negative-space-logo-design) — the empty space around text and graphics — is also an important consideration. Your brand guidelines should tell designers what fonts they can use and include explicit instructions regarding capitalization, spacing, and size.

## Style Guide

Think of the style guide as a comprehensive manual used to define your brand and promote consistent communication. Once you have a basic brand identity package, you can create a style guide by adding photography guidelines, rules for logo usage, and details to help content writers and other employees achieve just the right tone when developing your marketing materials.

The most comprehensive style guides also include rules for grammar, formatting, and word choice. For example, a brand style guide may contain a list of words that should never be used to refer to the brand or guidelines regarding the use of hyphens, bulleted lists, and serial commas.

## Others

### Social Media

Your social media pages should match your website and other promotional materials in terms of colors, fonts, and typography. One of the best ways to ensure consistency is to add social media graphics to your branding package. Many of these graphics are used as headings on profile pages, ensuring that anyone who sees your profile associates it with your brand.

You can also [hire a designer](https://dribbble.com/designers) to create video thumbnails, profile images, infographics, quote graphics, or any other type of [social media templates](https://dribbble.com/marketplace/templates/social-media). To deliver a cohesive experience to your target audience, these items should have the same look and feel as your other marketing materials.

### Stationery

As you create your branding package, don't forget about [stationery templates](https://dribbble.com/marketplace/templates/stationery) and guidelines for using company stationery in a way that's consistent with your brand image. These [stationery guidelines](https://brand.wm.edu/index.php/stationery/) from William & Mary are a good example of how to incorporate this information into your branding package. As you can see, they provide plenty of detail — right down to how to set the margins on each version of the letterhead — to help employees comply with the college's standards.

### Slide Deck Presentation Template

Many business branding packages also come with slide deck [presentation templates](https://dribbble.com/marketplace/templates/presentations), or collections of slides that can be used to create PowerPoint presentations. While creating a slide deck presentation template, be sure to refer to your branding guidelines. You should use the same typography, logos, and color palette for the slide deck template as you would for a poster or an email newsletter. When someone in your target audience sees the presentation, they should immediately associate the design with your brand.

### Email Templates

Before you write a single word of copy, you must have an eye-catching design that adheres to the guidelines in your branding package. Using email templates can help you save time and increase consistency, reducing the number of revisions needed before you click "send". According to the email marketing experts at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/blog/email-design-checklist/), a good email template should include the following elements:

-   **Logos:** Every email should include your company's logo. It's also standard to link your logo to your website to make it easier for readers to find out more about your company.
-   **Colors:** Use your standard color palette to choose colors for your email template. Your headline, dividers, buttons, and backgrounds should match the palette exactly.
-   **Images:** If you use images, they should support your brand identity and adhere to your company's photography guidelines.
-   **Text:** All text should be large enough for readers to see without having to enlarge their screens. It should also conform to your company's typography guidelines.
-   **Footer:** Ensure your footer matches your company's color palette and typography guidelines. Include your contact information to make it easier for readers to connect with you.

### Advertising Designs

Whether you're sticking to print or going digital, your branding package should include sample ad designs to guide graphic designers and advertising professionals as they create new campaigns. Each ad should contain your company name, your logo, a visual representation of your product or service offering, a value proposition, and a call-to-action button. Every element should also follow your brand guidelines in terms of typography, color palette, photography, and illustrations.

## Photography

Rachel Gillett of [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3035856/why-were-more-likely-to-remember-content-with-images-and-video-infogr) reports that people are more likely to remember content that has images in it. That makes high-quality photography extremely important for companies of all sizes. Whether you have an in-house photographer or plan to hire a freelancer, you can get better results if you take the time to include photography guidelines in your branding package.

You may want to write guidelines regarding composition, content, tone, and color palette. It's also a good idea to document whether you want to focus on people or objects in your company's photos. The more detail you include in your branding guidelines, the easier it is for a photographer to achieve just the right look. If you create a guideline emphasizing candid shots instead of posed photos, for example, your photographer will be able to plan accordingly.

## Miscellaneous Assets

Big companies may have more than a dozen assets in their brand packages. These assets include [icon sets](https://dribbble.com/resources/icon-set-guide), stickers, product packaging, signage, event branding, company merchandise ("merch"), and brochures. The more guidelines and samples you include in your [branding package](https://dribbble.com/tags/branding_package), the more opportunities you have to ensure consistency in every brand message. Including these items also makes it easier to hire and manage graphic designers, photographers, freelance writers, and other independent contractors who have the skills needed to grow your brand.
